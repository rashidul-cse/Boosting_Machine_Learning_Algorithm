The foremost purpose of this project  work was to develop a classifier that can more accurately classify spam and ham emails in the email transactions. In this case, i learnt about the ensemble techniques (AdaBoost) that generates several weak learner models like Na√Øve Bayes and combines these weak learner models to produce a final strong learner model. To implement this project of boosting Naive Bayes a Machine learning algorith by AdaBoost techniques, i used Python 3.6 environment.
